# The-Cartographer

Roguelike RPG being made in the Godot engine.  A programming and game design exercise in the style of Castle of the Winds and Dungeons of Doom.

## Key points: 
- Limited palette pixel art graphics
- Grid-based movement
- Inventory Management
- Items found improve the player's abilities
- RPG elements that improve the player's ability to use Items
- Exploration of procedurally generated dungeons
- Gradually introduced horror elements

## Interesting things:
- Stats level up based on use of the relevant skills.  If you don't use it, you don't level it up.
- All player abilites are granted by finding new equipment, and player growth makes more equipment usable and reliable
- Early game is adventurey, whereas midgame becomes increasingly more horrific
- Considering Networked and local multiplayer... dunno how yet.

# Caltrops! The RPG!

Investigate bringing the game and mechanics to the tabletop as a horror dungeon crawler... The Base-2 math might suit itself to rolling a ton of 4-sided dice. (or 4-sided dice with two indicated corners, d2's)
