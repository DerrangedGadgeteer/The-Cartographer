# Stamina System:

## Player has a Stamina stat.  
- It is full after a rest, and doing anything involving a specialty (or being attacked) depletes it.  
- It recovers gradually while the player isn't doing anything.  
- If a player doesn't have enough stamina, the player cannot perform a specialty action without risking injury and falling unconscious.    
- If a player has no stamina, the player falls unconscious.  
- An unconscious player cannot move or perform any actions
- While unconscious, (unless wounded) the player recovers stamina as if they're resting, and once stamina is positive again, the player can move and perform actions again.
- If a player's action takes them below zero Stamina, each point of negative Stamina becomes a chance to Wound the Player.

## Being Attacked depletes Stamina
- Attacks from enemies have an attack value, adjusted by random chance
- Armor, Enchantments, Spells, and Skills in the relevant sort of Combat reduce the attack value
- Remaining Attack Value is depleted from defender's Stamina
- If an Attack drops the defender to zero Stamina, the defender is knocked unconscious
- If an Attack drops the defender below zero Stamina, each point of Attack Value becomes a chance to Wound the defender.

## Wounds
- Each point of negative Stamina is counted as a chance to wound the character when inflicted/incurred.
- The first point has a 1/X chance to Wound.
- - Difficulty determines "X"
- - - Hard X=16, -4 Stamina for 50% chance to Wound, -5 Automatic Wound*
- - - Normal X=128 -7 Stamina for 50% chance to Wound, -8 Automatic Wound*
- - - Easy X=1024 -10 Stamina for 50% chance to Wound, -11 Automatic Wound*
- Each subsequent point of negative Stamina has double the previous chance
- While Wounded, a player doesn't regain Stamina over time.  
- When a player is first Wounded, they regain consciousness at 1 point of Stamina
- If a player who is wounded falls unconscious, they do not recover Stamina while unconscious, and will remain unconscious unless helped.

## Mortally Wounded
- If a player who is already wounded gets wounded again, they are then Mortally Wounded.
- When a player is first Mortally Wounded, they remain unconscious at 0 Stamina
- While Mortally wounded, a player doesn't regain stamina over time.
- If an item, spell, or the actions of a Party Member restore a Mortally Wounded Player's Stamina, that restored Stamina ticks back down to 0 at a rate of "Y" points per turn.
- - Difficulty determines "Y"
- - - Hard Y=4*
- - - Normal Y=2*
- - - Easy Y=1*

## Death
- A Mortally Wounded player has a 1/Z chance to Die each turn. 
- - Difficulty determines "Z"
- - - Hard Z=4*
- - - Normal Z=8*
- - - Easy Z=16*
- If a Mortally Wounded player accumulates Negative Stamina, the player dies.

## Massive Damage
- If an attack is made that inflicts more Negative Stamina than the Automatic Wound Threshold, then remaining Negative Stamina is accumulated and figured against the stamina like a separate attack/action would.
- If that accumulated Negative Stamina Mortally Wounds the player and still has Negative Stamina accumulated, that Player Dies outright from Massive Damage.
> Example: 
>>Player has 8 Stamina, and recieves 25 Negative Stamina, (Difficulty: Easy)
>>Player hits 0 Stamina, falls Unconscious, 17 Negative Stamina remains
>>11 Negative Stamina means Player is Automatically Wounded, 6 Negative Stamina Remains
>>Player Regains Consciousness, Player is now Wounded, Player has 1 Stamina, 6 Negative Stamina Remains
>>Player hits 0 Stamina again, falls Unconscious again, 5 Negative Stamina means 5 chances for wounds.
>>First Chance for Mortal Wounds: 1/1024 chance, Player doesn't get wounded,
>>2nd Chance: 1/512 chance, 
>>3rd Chance: 1/256 chance,  
>>4th Chance: 1/128 chance, Player gets unlucky and gets Mortally Wounded, 0 Stamina,
>>Mortally Wounded Player is at 1 Negative Stamina and dies.


## Restoration, First Aid, and Healing.
- Potions, Scrolls, Spells, and Enchanted Items "...of Vigor" restore Stamina irrespective of whether the Player is Wounded.
- - These are common items to find
- Potions, Scrolls, Spells, and Enchanted Items "...of Healing" return a Wounded Player to Normal, or make a Mortally Wounded player merely Wounded.
- - These are rare items,
- - These do not restore Stamina
- Potions, Scrolls, Spells, and Enchanted Items "...of Restoration" combine the effects of "Vigor" and "Healing" Items.
- - These are exceedingly rare items.
- - "...of Restoration" will return a Wounded Player to Normal or return a Mortally Wounded player to Wounded, and restore half of maximum Stamina.
- - "..of Greater Restoration" will return a player in any condition to Normal with full Stamina.

# Notes:

- Wound chance: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, (Hardmode) 32, 64, 128, (Normal Mode) 256, 512, 1024 (Easy Mode) 
- Don't use a simple "Plus to hit" magic weapon.  Make them all interesting in some way.
